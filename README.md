# House Price Prediction 

## Overview
End-to-end machine learning project predicting residential house prices using the Kaggle
"House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset.

The project covers data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation,
with XGBoost selected as the final model based on performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and normalization
- Categorical encoding using OneHotEncoder
- Model training with GridSearchCV
- Model comparison and selection
- Final inference for Kaggle submission

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (best-performing model)

## Notes
This repository focuses on the full machine learning workflow, including data exploration,
feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Kaggle submission file generation is environment-specific and is not the primary focus of
this project. The emphasis is on building, tuning, and comparing predictive models rather
than producing a competition submission file.
